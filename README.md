# React/TypeScript interview test

### The mission

Enhance this poorly coded little application and try to fix the following points: 

**🪲 Bugs**\
The application has a few bugs. Find and resolve them!

**️📦 Reusability**\
`Table` should work with any kind of data, not only `User`.

**🏎 Performance**\
Consider that the application could be led to **work with hundreds of thousands of rows**. In its current state, it is not performance enough to face this load. Try to optimize the performance by any means possible!

**✅ Typing**\
Remove as much `any` as possible. Force correctness of `Table` parameters. 
In short use all the power of _TypeScript_ to ensure code safety. 


### Notes

This code faces a huge amount of issues, some of which could be hard to find. 
Don't worry if you don't find everything; simply do your best. 
Feel free to build something significantly different, but ensure the existing features work:

- Limiting rows
- Searching by ID
- Cell edition
- Sorting by a given column

Also, feel free to showcase your CSS skills 🙂.

⚠️ The file [api-readonly-file.ts](src%2Fapi-readonly-file.ts) simulates an API call. Don't edit it.
